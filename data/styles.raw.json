    "The rain-slicked scene was shrouded in darkness, with a lone figure in a fedora and trench coat standing beneath a flickering neon sign. The scene was straight out of a classic film noir, evoking the dark and brooding style of directors like Hitchcock and Welles",
    "The dimly lit room was bathed in shadows, casting a moody and mysterious atmosphere over the scene. A lone figure, dressed in a long trench coat and fedora, leaned against a brick wall smoking a cigarette, the smoke curling around their face. \nIn the distance, a neon sign flickered, illuminating the rain-soaked pavement below. The scene was reminiscent of a classic film noir, evoking the dark and brooding style of directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, and Billy Wilder."
