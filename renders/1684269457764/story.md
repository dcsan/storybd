Ginger is met with screams and heckles.

She pushes past her two lawyers to a mic-covered podium. Hecklers boo. Her lawyers

<div class='dialog'>Tiara: Move over, boys. They want to see me.</div>

Ginger blows kisses to hecklers as she descends the stairs to a waiting shimmering gold Monocorp JUMPER — an autonomous quadcopter VTOL passenger drone covered in a matrix of marquee bulbs that move in abstract patterns. futuristic film noir anime comic book high contrast illustration

</details>


The club’s scruffy, ragtag performers - most likely sex workers - wear green screen suits with surgical gloves, respiratory masks and minimal costume accessories: ears, butt plugs attached to rubber tails, alien headgear, strap-on dildos and artificial pussies.

An avatar RINGMASTER (30s, man, handsome wearing red tail coat with chain closure, vest dickey with attached bow tie, top hat) appears and hypes the lonesome crowd.

The PROPRIETOR (THAI LADYBOY, 30s, beautiful) hands Tiara an old Oculus-like tech headset like loaner shoes at a bowling alley.

The DJ (20-something, tall, piercing blue eyes and long hair) put a needle on the record. He stares at Tiara.
Together the performers dance and sing a sorta Lady Marmalade-like anthem that belies their weariness and despair.

From the POV of the AR headset, the club’s crude sets transform into something magical, and shaggy cosplay performers now appear as fully-realized anthropomorphic animals, avatars, aliens, and anime characters. It’s like a perverse cartoon that’s magnificently come to life!

<div class='dialog'>actor: California rocks like Bangkok!</div>

Without the headset (a true case of rose-colored glasses) Tiara watches the cold reality of jaded performers giving perfunctory lap dances and gloved hand jobs to the sad and lonely headset-wearing female and male patrons - miserable social outliers you might find in a strip club.



# ConferenceRoom 


Tiara, Hadji and Jamal sit eyeing each other.

Jamal has his feet up on the table with a joint in his mouth. His face is partially hidden in shadows.

Hadji drinks from his flask.

Tiara, still in sunglasses, taps her leg, lights a cigarette and - with a french inhale - starts the convo.

<div class='dialog'>Tiara: I hope this doesn't take long. I'm in the middle of shooting.</div>

<div class='dialog'>Jamal: Shooting? I thought poison was your “trade murk”.</div>

<div class='dialog'>Tiara: Excuse me? You know me?</div>

Jamal leans forward into the light, gold tooth gleaming.

<div class='dialog'>Jamal: I know ya moved grande dame’s name from the marquee to a tombstone. Changed her wonderful life from an “is” to a “was”.</div>
