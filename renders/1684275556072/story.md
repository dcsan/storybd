# Jamal 


Jamal pulls out an old photo of him and his girlfriend. In his denim coat, he, too, finds a snow globe: “Life is like a snow globe - it’s most beautiful when shaken up.”

Two turban-wearing DRUG DEALERS twirl glowing umbrellas that illuminate their ghoulish faces. One opens up his trench coat and reveals drugs. Jamal snatches the bag but doesn’t pay. He’s too big to stop.

He’s strung out — smoking and drinking from a sake flask.

Tiara ducks inside.



# Hadji 


The club features a cheaply designed fiberglass, foam alien garden set design. It’s a faux bio-luminescent grassland teeming with “exotic” plants and underwater coral reefs and plankton. More depressing than magical.

The club’s scruffy, ragtag performers - most likely sex workers - wear green screen suits with surgical gloves, respiratory masks and minimal costume accessories: ears, butt plugs attached to rubber tails, alien headgear, strap-on dildos and artificial pussies.

From the POV of the AR headset, the club’s crude sets transform into something magical, and shaggy cosplay performers now appear as fully-realized anthropomorphic animals, avatars, aliens, and anime characters. It’s like a perverse cartoon that’s magnificently come to life!

<div class='dialog'>> actor: California rocks like Bangkok!</div>

Without the headset (a true case of rose-colored glasses) Tiara watches the cold reality of jaded performers giving perfunctory lap dances and gloved hand jobs to the sad and lonely headset-wearing female and male patrons - miserable social outliers you might find in a strip club.



# ConferenceRoom 


Tiara, Hadji and Jamal sit eyeing each other.

Jamal has his feet up on the table with a joint in his mouth. His face is partially hidden in shadows.

Hadji drinks from his flask.

Tiara, still in sunglasses, taps her leg, lights a cigarette and - with a french inhale - starts the convo.

<div class='dialog'>> Tiara: I hope this doesn't take long. I'm in the middle of shooting.</div>

<div class='dialog'>> Jamal: Shooting? I thought poison was your “trade murk”.</div>

<div class='dialog'>> Tiara: Excuse me? You know me?</div>

Jamal leans forward into the light, gold tooth gleaming.

<div class='dialog'>> Jamal: I know ya moved grande dame’s name from the marquee to a tombstone. Changed her wonderful life from an “is” to a “was”.</div>
